\title{Thresholds for influenza intensity}
\usage{
memintensity(i.flu)
}
\arguments{
\item{i.flu}{An object of class \code{mem}.}
}
\value{
\code{memintensity} returns a list with three objects, two of them are the parameters
used (\code{param.levels} and \code{param.seasons}) and the third one
(\code{intensity.thresholds}) is a matrix 1x4 with the epidemic and intensity thresholds.
\enumerate{
\item Epidemic threshold.
\item Low intensity threshold.
\item Medium intensity threshold.
\item High intensity threshold.
}
}
\description{
Function \code{memintensity} is used to calculate the thresholds for influenza activity
using historical records (surveillance rates).\cr
}
\details{
This method is based on the Moving Epidemics Method (MEM) used to monitor influenza
activity in a weekly surveillance system.

Input data is a data frame containing rates that represent historical influenza surveillance
data. It can start and end at any given week (tipically at week 40th), and rates can be
expressed as per 100,000 inhabitants (or per consultations, if population is not
available) or any other scale.

MEM is used to locate the epidemic for each season. Then confidence intervals are
calculated at different levels.

The parameter \code{i.levels}, define the three levels of the confidence intervals
used to calculate thresholds.

The \code{i.n.max} parameter indicates how many epidemic values to use to calculate
the thresholds. A value of -1 indicates the program to use an appropiate number of
points depending on the number of seasons provided as input.

The \code{i.seasons} parameter indicates how many seasons are used for calculating
thresholds. A value of -1 indicates the program to use as many as possible. If there
are less than this parameter, the program used all seasons avalaible.

Intensity thresholds and Epidemic threshold defines 5 levels of intensity:

\enumerate{
\item Baseline level - Below epidemic threshold.
\item Low level - Above epidemic threshold and below low intensity threshold.
\item Medium level - Above low intensity threshold and below medium intensity threshold.
\item High level - Above medium intensity threshold and below high intensity threshold.
\item Very high level - Above high intensity threshold.
